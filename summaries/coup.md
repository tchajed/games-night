# Coup

Coup is a game of deception and hidden identities. It's fast-paced, which makes up for the luck involved in any single game.

## Goal

You begin with two cards facedown in front of you (your "influence"). The goal is to be the last one with any remaining influence. Each turn, you can perform the **action of any character** (follow the cheat sheet), claiming to have that character. At any time, you can challenge someone's action, thinking they don't have that character. If they don't have it, they **lose an influence** and the action is cancelled: they choose one of their cards to flip over, which they then lose for the rest of the game. If they do have it, they reveal it, shuffle it into the deck, and redraw, and as the challenger you lose an influence. Lying is encouraged.

Asassin     Assasinate       Pay 3 coins
                             choose player to lose influence
Ambassador  Exchange         Exchange cards with deck            Blocks stealing
Captain     Steal            Take 2 coins from someone           Blocks stealing
Contessa                                                         Blocks assasination

A few notes:

* Counter-actions are actions you can take when you have that character against others. For example, someone can block your taking 2 coins for foreign aid, claiming to have a Duke. These can be challenged.
* The Ambassador exchanges by drawing two cards and deciding which two of the four they have to keep. They should shuffle so players can't see whether they kept the old or new cards.
* When you block stealing, you need to state whether it is with an Ambassador or a Captain.

## Coup Reformation teams

There is a variant from the expansion with teams. The game still has a single winner, but you cannot steal from, assasinate or coup your own team. You may pay 1 coin to change your team and 2 coins to change someone else's team.

Money that is used to change teams goes to the center. Now, as long as you don't have a duke, you have an additional **embezzle** action where they you take all the money in the center. If you're challenged and you have a duke, you lose an influence of your choice. Otherwise, you have to show both of your cards, shuffle them in, and replace them, while your challenger loses an influence.
