# Werewords

Werewords is a cross between 20 questions and Werewolf/Mafia/One Night Ultimate
Werewolf. That is, you're trying to guess a hidden word but there are some
people who don't want it guessed.

Everybody in the game has a hidden role, which will be either on either the
Village (good) team or the Werewolf (evil) team. Someone will also be the Major,
which is public. The mayor will have a secret word, given by the app, that
everyone is trying to guess by asking yes/no questions, which the mayor will
answer by handing out the double-sided yes/no tokens. The Village team is trying
to guess the word, while the Werewolf team is trying to prevent it from being
guessed. The round ends either when the game timer runs out (typically set for 5
minutes), or when we run out of yes/no tokens. To help out, the village team as
a Seer who also knows the word.

At the end of the game, each team has a chance to redeem themselves. If the word
is guessed and the Villagers are about to win, the Werewolf team can still win by
guessing and killing the Seer (this prevents the Seer from, say, immediately guessing the
word). If the word isn't guessed and the Werewolf team is about to win, the
Villagers can still win by guessing an evil player.

Note that the Mayor also has a secret role! That means the Mayor might be a
Werewolf, in which case their goal is to prevent the word from being guessed.
However, the app will reveal the word at the end, so if the answers were
obviously unhelpful the Mayor will out themselves. Note that there's no rule
that says you have to "tell the truth" - you should try to be helpful if you're
good, and try not to be without being obvious if you're evil. If the Mayor is
also the Seer, tough luck for the good team that round (on the other hand, the
Werewolf team is unlikely to guess the Mayor if the word is guessed).

## Gameplay

Select roles, one per player. With many players (eg, 7+), you might want to add a second
Werewolf, or a Beholder (who knows the Seer but not the word), or a Minion.
The Minion is on the Werewolf team, does not know the word, and knows the
Werewolves, but the Werewolves do not know the Minion. If good team fails to
guess the word and kills the Minion, they win.

The Mayor will need to use the app, everyone else should be able to see it if
they're a werewolf or the seer.

The Mayor answers **every question**, in order, by handing out a token. There are
Maybe tokens (useful if, for example, the question doesn't make sense or the
Mayor doesn't know the answer), one "So Close" token, and a "Correct" token.

The round ends if the word is guessed, and the word is not guessed if time runs
out or the yes/no tokens run out.

At the end, if the word is guessed: the Werewolves (not Minion) reveal their
roles, have a minute to discuss, then each pick a player to kill. **Evil wins** if
they kill the Seer.

At the end, if the word is not guessed: the group has a minute to discuss who is
evil, then everyone votes for an execution. The Minion's vote does not count.
The player(s) with the most votes die; if there's a tie, multiple people can
die. As long as _at least one_ evil player dies, **good wins**.
