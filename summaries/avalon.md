# Avalon

Avalon, similar to the Resistance, is a game of deception and hidden identities. It involves a good deal of discussion, deduction, and baseless accusation, and easily runs for 1--2 fun hours.

## Goal

Players are assigned a hidden identity that places them on the good (blue) or bad (red) team. The group votes on players to go on 5 missions in turn; the members of that mission can either succeed or fail it; any failure vote causes the whole mission to fail. The goal of the blue team is to \textcolor{blue}{succeed three missions}, while the red team is trying to \textcolor{red}{fail three missions}. The red team members know each other while the blue team does not.

## Procedures

The high-level flow of the game is as follows (full details appear shortly):

- team is **proposed**
- everyone votes **approve/reject** (public)
- if approved, team members vote **fail/success** (hidden)
- if rejected, next person proposes
- essentially, the fifth proposal is **automatically approved**
- after three successes or failures the game is over

The actual gameplay is structured to facilitate this process while hiding information and tracking information. For each mission, a **crown** moves around indicating who will propose a team; use the shields to indicate the team members you are proposing. There is a **simultaneous**, **public** vote with the yes/no cardstock chips; much of the social deduction comes from these votes. If a majority of players vote yes, the mission embarks with the **proposed members voting succeed/fail** with cards. All success/failure cards are shuffled and revealed, so votes are secret. Red team can \textcolor{red}{choose whether or not to fail} the mission, while blue team \textcolor{blue}{must succeed}. If the proposal is voted down, the next person proposes. The fifth proposal must pass or the red team wins (we call this "ultimate power"). The card in the middle tracks much of this information, including the results of missions and the vote counter. It also gives the number of people that must go on each mission. Note that for games with 6+ players, the fourth mission needs two failure cards to fail.

## Roles

What makes Avalon interesting is the use of special roles on both teams. You pick which roles to play with; often you can add more roles with more players. The information listed here is disseminated at the beginning of the game.

- \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} knows all the red players except \textcolor{red}{Mordred}
- \textcolor{blue}{Percival} knows who \textcolor{red}{Morgana} and \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} are, but not which is which.
- thus, \textcolor{red}{Mordred} leverages that \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} doesn't know who he is
- thus, \textcolor{red}{Morgana} tries to appear as \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} to \textcolor{blue}{Percival}
- at the end of the game, if three missions have passed, the \textcolor{red}{Assassin} gets to try to pick who \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} is. If he is correct, **red wins automatically**. This is to prevent \textcolor{blue}{Merlin} from revealing himself obviously.
- \textcolor{red}{Oberon} does not know who the red players are.
